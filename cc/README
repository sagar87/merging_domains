Implementation of connected components using a quickfind array has the advantage representing
the graph in very sparse representation. To run cc.py on your graph make sure that it has
the following format

<incoming node>	<terminal node>	<edgeweight>

The cc.py procedure will yield the same graph with an annotation of the component in the first
column of the graph file.

<component>	<initial_node>	<terminal_node>	<edge_weigt>

For further processing of the data it might be useful to sort the edges with respect to their
components. This can be done easily in Unix systems by invoking the sort command:

sort -n -k 2 unsorted_graph.dat > sorted_graph.dat
